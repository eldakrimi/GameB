# GameB
# C-game

This was a school project in C/C++ developed on Mac in XxCode.  
The project was to build a game engine with certain requirement depending what grade you aimed for. 
I met all the requirements and recieved the highest grade:

E: 
Sse C++ and SDL
Sse object oriented programing with ineherentance and polymorphism
Make a generel baseclass for all your game characters, sprite,  and let the user be able to make subclasses. 
Sse encapsulation
Make sure ther is no memory leakage
The game engine is going to be able to handle both keyboard and mouse input and react to them accoring the users wishes. 
Simple collition handling - not on pixel-level. 

D:
The user is going to be able to set frame rate
There must be different types of sprites/game characters with different features. ex. moving sprites. 

C: 
One sub-class of the base character/sprite is going to be animated, represented with severeal images that changes based on ticks or  sprite sheet. 
The game engine is going to be prepared to implementations of keyboard shortcuts. 
The user is going to set a key and a callback-function that will be called when the key os pressed. 

B:
The gameengine should be prepared for handlign different levels. 
The user is going to be able to create different scenes with different game characters/sprote objects and background pictures. 
The shortcut key command should med tied to a member function in certain objects
It is going to be easy for the user to name a function pointer or combination of a function pointer an object pointer.  
There is going to be  a graphical component that the user kan use for text input. 

A: 
Collition detection on pixel-level. 
The game engine is going to impelement som functionality of a physics enginge. Moving sprites should be affected by gravity, 
bounce of eachother and have som elacicity the effects the gravity.
